## KnowYourWaste

With the booming population all over the world and rapidly exhausting  resources it has become vital to understand the need for management of  the waste generated by humans and the recycling of these waste  products to enhance their usability. Waste management is an immense  hassle because the rate of waste production is far more than the rate at  which waste is recycled. To tackle this problem the participation of the  general population is required besides the government and the private  sector.

In order to make people contribute to the waste management process, we  aim to build a Smartphone-based application that can help classify waste  products based on their images and then prompt the user the best way to  get those products recycled. Based on the scale of waste detected by the  user we will also connect them to their nearby waste managing  organizations and facilities.
